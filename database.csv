Physics,Economics,Dynamics of phase transitions in,"We studied the slow dynamics of phase transitions in Ba1−𝑥⁢Sr𝑥⁢V13⁢O18, which is composed of quasitriangular lattices of V ions and exhibits a phase transition into a V orbital ordered state with V trimerization. We found a clear time dependence of magnetic susceptibility and strain on a phase transition, and the transformation time estimated from the time dependence exhibits a peculiar temperature dependence, consistent with nucleation-growth behavior. Detailed analysis indicates that there is a distribution of the transformation time in Ba1−𝑥⁢Sr𝑥⁢V13⁢O18, and the formation of twin structures associated with the phase transition may affect the nucleation-growth dynamics and causes such a distribution of the transformation time.",10.1103/PhysRevB.106.045124,phase transitions,Phase transitions,"evolution, paradigm shifts",Tipping points,Tipping points in macroeconomic agent-based models,"The aim of this work is to explore the possible types of phenomena that simple macroeconomic Agent-Based models (ABMs) can reproduce. We propose a methodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model through its “phase diagram” in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is to understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the “Mark I” ABM devised by Delli Gatti and collaborators. In this regard, our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a “good economy” where unemployment is low, and a “bad economy” where unemployment is high. We then introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show that this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is generically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of firing of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping point, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such that the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified as the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several natural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold, limiting the firms maximum level of debt-to-sales ratio. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in particular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the unemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce simple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the “good” phase) or deflation (in the “bad” phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the model essentially unchanged. We have also explored the effect of simple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang crises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to model macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to reach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.",10.1016/j.jedc.2014.08.003,,Structural Analogies,
Control Theory,Cognitive Science,Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination,"A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.",10.1038/nn963,stochastic optimal feedback control,Feedback,Motor control,Brain stimulation therapy,Subthalamic control of impulsive actions: insights from deep brain stimulation,"Control of actions allows adaptive, goal-directed behaviour. The basal ganglia, including the subthalamic nucleus, are thought to play a central role in dynamically controlling actions through recurrent negative feedback loops with the cerebral cortex. Here, we summarize recent translational studies that used deep brain stimulation to record neural activity from and apply electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus in people with Parkinson’s disease. These studies have elucidated spatial, spectral and temporal features of the neural mechanisms underlying the controlled delay of actions in cortico-subthalamic networks and demonstrated their causal effects on behaviour in distinct processing windows. While these mechanisms have been conceptualized as control signals for suppressing impulsive response tendencies in conflict tasks and as decision threshold adjustments in value-based and perceptual decisions, we propose a common framework linking decision-making, cognition and movement. Within this framework, subthalamic deep brain stimulation can lead to suboptimal choices by reducing the time that patients take for deliberation before committing to an action. However, clinical studies have consistently shown that the occurrence of impulse control disorders is reduced, not increased, after subthalamic deep brain stimulation surgery. This apparent contradiction can be reconciled when recognizing the multifaceted nature of impulsivity, its underlying mechanisms and modulation by treatment. While subthalamic deep brain stimulation renders patients susceptible to making decisions without proper forethought, this can be disentangled from effects related to dopamine comprising sensitivity to benefits versus costs, reward delay aversion and learning from outcomes. Alterations in these dopamine-mediated mechanisms are thought to underlie the development of impulse control disorders and can be relatively spared with reduced dopaminergic medication after subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Together, results from studies using deep brain stimulation as an experimental tool have improved our understanding of action control in the human brain and have important implications for treatment of patients with neurological disorders.",10.1093/brain/awad302,,Structural Analogies,

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical technique currently investigated for medically-refractory psychiatric disorders. Here, we use the poly I:C rat model of schizophrenia to study the effects of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (Nacc) DBS on two behavioral schizophrenia-like deficits, i.e. sensorimotor gating, as reflected by disrupted prepulse inhibition (PPI), and attentional selectivity, as reflected by disrupted latent inhibition (LI). In addition, the neurocircuitry influenced by DBS was studied using FDG PET. We found that mPFC- and Nacc-DBS alleviated PPI and LI abnormalities in poly I:C offspring, whereas Nacc- but not mPFC-DBS disrupted PPI and LI in saline offspring. In saline offspring, mPFC-DBS increased metabolism in the parietal cortex, striatum, ventral hippocampus and Nacc, while reducing it in the brainstem, cerebellum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Nacc-DBS, on the other hand, increased activity in the ventral hippocampus and olfactory bulb and reduced it in the septal area, brainstem, periaqueductal gray and hypothalamus. In poly I:C offspring changes in metabolism following mPFC-DBS were similar to those recorded in saline offspring, except for a reduced activity in the brainstem and hypothalamus. In contrast, Nacc-DBS did not induce any statistical changes in brain metabolism in poly I:C offspring. Our study shows that mPFC- or Nacc-DBS delivered to the adult progeny of poly I:C treated dams improves deficits in PPI and LI. Despite common behavioral responses, stimulation in the two targets induced different metabolic effects.",10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.06.012,,Shared/Applied Concepts,
Chemistry,Materials Science,Design and self-assembly of hexahedral coordination cages for cascade reactions,"The search for supramolecular reactors that contain no catalytically active sites but can promote chemical transformations has received significant attention, but it remains a synthetic challenge. Here we demonstrate a strategy of incorporating bulky and electro-rich aromatic linkers into metallocages to induce cascade reactions. Two hexahedral cages with a framework formula [(Zn8L6)(OTf)16] are assembled from six tetrakis-bidentate ligands derived from tetraphenylethylene and eight zinc(II)tris(pyridylimine) centers. The cage cavities can accommodate different molecules such as anthranilamide and aromatic aldehyde through supramolecular interactions, allowing for a cascade condensation and cyclization to produce nonplanar 2,3-dihyroquinazolinones. The reaction is highly efficient with high rate enhancements (up to kcat/kuncat = 38,000) and multiple turnovers compared to the bulk reaction mixture. Control experiments and molecular simulations suggest that the acceleration is attributed to inherent strength of binding affinity for reactants and the release of products to establish catalytic turnover is due to the host−guest geometry discrepancy.",10.1038/s41467-018-06872-0,supramolecular cages,molecular self-assembly,self-ordering materials,crystal growth,Colloidal crystal grain boundary formation and motion,"The ability to assemble nano- and micro- sized colloidal components into highly ordered configurations is often cited as the basis for developing advanced materials. However, the dynamics of stochastic grain boundary formation and motion have not been quantified, which limits the ability to control and anneal polycrystallinity in colloidal based materials. Here we use optical microscopy, Brownian Dynamic simulations and a new dynamic analysis to study grain boundary motion in quasi-2D colloidal bicrystals formed within inhomogeneous AC electric fields. We introduce “low-dimensional” models using reaction coordinates for condensation and global order that capture first passage times between critical configurations at each applied voltage. The resulting models reveal that equal sized domains at a maximum misorientation angle show relaxation dominated by friction limited grain boundary diffusion; and in contrast, asymmetrically sized domains with less misorientation display much faster grain boundary migration due to significant thermodynamic driving forces. By quantifying such dynamics vs. compression (voltage), kinetic bottlenecks associated with slow grain boundary relaxation are understood, which can be used to guide the temporal assembly of defect-free single domain colloidal crystals.",10.1038/srep06132,,Shared/Applied Concepts,
Biology,Computer Science,Signaling through G protein coupled receptors,"Heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα, Gβ/Gγ subunits) constitute one of the most important components of cell signaling cascade. G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) perceive many extracellular signals and transduced them to heterotrimeric G proteins, which further transduced the signals intracellular to appropriate downstream effectors and thereby play an important role in various signaling pathways. GPCRs exist as a superfamily of integral membrane protein receptors that contain seven transmembrane α-helical regions, which bind to a wide range of ligands. Upon activation by a ligand, the GPCR undergoes a conformational change and then activate the G proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP/GTP associated with the Gα subunit. This leads to the dissociation of Gβ/Gγ dimer from Gα. Both these moieties then become free to act upon their downstream effectors and thereby initiate unique intracellular signaling responses. After the signal propagation, the GTP of Gα-GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and Gα becomes inactive (Gα-GDP), which leads to its re-association with the Gβ/Gγ dimer to form the inactive heterotrimeric complex. The GPCR can also transduced the signal through G protein independent pathway. GPCRs also regulate cell cycle progression. Till to date thousands of GPCRs are known from animal kingdom with little homology among them, but only single GPCR has been identified in plant system, which was reported to be cell cycle regulated and also involved in ABA and in stress signaling. Here I have described a general mechanism of signal transduction through GPCR/G proteins, structure of GPCRs, family of GPCRs and plant GPCR and its role.",10.4161/psb.4.10.9530,biomolecule signalling,Signal transduction,network communication,computer neural networks,Event-driven adaptive optical neural network,"We present an adaptive optical neural network based on a large-scale event-driven architecture.

Using multimode focusing, the activation function features both excitatory and inhibitory responses and shows a reversible switching contrast of 3.2 decibels. We train the neural network to distinguish between English and German text samples via an evolutionary algorithm. We investigate both the synaptic and structural plasticity during the training process.

The understanding of the underlying thermodynamics of such systems remains an important problem. Here, we derive the entropy for structure-forming systems that differs from Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy by a term that explicitly captures clustered states. For large systems and low concentrations the approach is equivalent to the grand-canonical ensemble; for small systems we find significant deviations. We derive the detailed fluctuation theorem and Crooks’ work fluctuation theorem for structure-forming systems. The connection to the theory of particle self-assembly is discussed.

The analysis of the experimental system was supported by the development of a stochastic model of the entropy source, which, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, has not yet been properly described. This resulted in the analytical equations for the probability of possible output quantum states depending on the initial properties of the system. Based on the presented model, the quantum efficiency and the Shannon entropy were calculated and compared with experimentally obtained values, which resulted in full agreement between these data. Additional statistical tests were performed on random numbers obtained theoretically and experimentally to confirm their high degree of randomness and their usability in cryptographic applications. The fact that the developed system is based on fibre optics allows it to operate in stable conditions with a final efficiency at the level of 15%, which provides a random number generation rate of about 8 kb/s.

Ecology,Network Science,Global impacts of future urban expansion on terrestrial vertebrate diversity,"Rapid urban expansion has profound impacts on global biodiversity through habitat conversion, degradation, fragmentation, and species extinction. However, how future urban expansion will affect global biodiversity needs to be better understood. We contribute to filling this knowledge gap by combining spatially explicit projections of urban expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with datasets on habitat and terrestrial biodiversity (amphibians, mammals, and birds). Overall, future urban expansion will lead to 11–33 million hectares of natural habitat loss by 2100 under the SSP scenarios and will disproportionately cause large natural habitat fragmentation. The urban expansion within the current key biodiversity priority areas is projected to be higher (e.g., 37–44% higher in the WWF’s Global 200) than the global average. Moreover, the urban land conversion will reduce local within-site species richness by 34% and species abundance by 52% per 1 km grid cell, and 7–9 species may be lost per 10 km cell. Our study suggests an urgent need to develop a sustainable urban development pathway to balance urban expansion and biodiversity conservation.",10.1038/s41467-022-29324-2,urban expansion,population dynamics,biodiversity loss,Network robustness,Robustness and resilience of complex networks,"Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.",10.1038/s42254-023-00676-y,,Cross-Cutting Themes/Grand Challenges,
Ecology,Computer Science,Emergence of structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks,"Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities1,2,3. Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture4,5 independent of species composition and latitude6,7; specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species1. Despite sustained efforts5,8,9,10 to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus11,12,13. Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community.

In particular, the goal is to propose a filter method to select a subset of time series. Consequently, we adopt the framework proposed by Brown al. [1]. The key point in this framework is the computation of the mutual information between the features, which allows us to measure the relevance of each feature subset. In our case, where the features are a time series, we use an adaptation of existing nonparametric mutual information estimators based on the k-nearest neighbor. Specifically, for the purpose of bringing these methods to the time series scenario, we rely on the use of dynamic time warping dissimilarity. Our experimental results show that our method is able to strongly reduce the number of time series while keeping or increasing the classification accuracy.",10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107525,,Methodological Links,
Genomics,Sociology,Monoallelic gene expression in developing cells increases genetic noise and Shannon entropy,"Monoallelic gene expression is a pivotal phenomenon in developmental biology, notably through the influence of imprinted genes. Our model predicts that monoallelic expression generates expression variability, which we assess by measuring genetic noise and entropy within Shannon’s information theory framework. Analyzing single-cell allele-specific expression across human and mouse datasets, we consistently observe increased expression variability due to monoallelic expression, affecting both imprinted and co-expressed non-imprinted genes. Moreover, we find decreasing variability in developing neurons and increasing variability in glial cells. The discovery of distinct noise patterns in over 80% of analyzed genes between glial and neuronal populations highlights the importance of differential noise in neurodevelopmental processes. Given the critical role of imprinted genes in biological processes such as growth and brain development, disruptions in their expression might contribute to various disorders.

Memes are an emerging aspect of the internet system of signification, and their visual schemes evolve by adapting to a heterogeneous context. A fundamental question is whether they present culturally and temporally transcendent characteristics in their organizing principles. In this work, we study the evolution of 2 million visual memes published on Reddit over ten years, from 2011 to 2020, in terms of their statistical complexity and entropy. A combination of a deep neural network and a clustering algorithm is used to group memes according to the underlying templates. The grouping of memes is the cornerstone to trace the growth curve of these objects. We observe an exponential growth of the number of new created templates with a doubling time of approximately 6 months, and find that long-lasting templates are associated with strong early adoption.

Medicine,Physics,Modulation of DBS-induced cortical responses and movement by beta power in Parkinson's disease,"Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective therapy for alleviating motor symptoms in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP), although some may not receive optimal clinical benefits. One potential mechanism of STN-DBS involves antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway (HDP), thus suppressing cortical beta synchrony to improve motor function, albeit the precise mechanisms underlying optimal DBS parameters are not well understood. To address this, 18 PwP with STN-DBS completed a 2 Hz monopolar stimulation of the left STN during MEG. MEG data were imaged in the time-frequency domain using minimum norm estimation. Peak vertex time series data were extracted to interrogate the directional specificity and magnitude of DBS current on evoked and induced cortical responses and accelerometer metrics of finger tapping using linear mixed-effects models and mediation analyses. We observed increases in evoked responses (HDP ~ 3–10 ms) and synchronization of beta oscillatory power (14–30 Hz, 10–100 ms) following DBS pulse onset in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), supplementary motor area (SMA) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) ipsilateral to the site of stimulation. DBS parameters significantly modulated neural and behavioral outcomes, with clinically effective contacts eliciting significant increases in medium-latency evoked responses, reductions in induced SM1 beta power, and better movement profiles compared to suboptimal contacts, often regardless of the magnitude of current applied. Finally, HDP-related improvements in motor function were mediated by the degree of SM1 beta suppression in a setting-dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that DBS-evoked brain-behavior dynamics are influenced by the level of beta power in key hubs of the basal ganglia-cortical loop, and this effect is exacerbated by the clinical efficacy of DBS parameters. Such data provides novel mechanistic and clinical insight, which may prove useful for characterizing DBS programming strategies to optimize motor symptom improvement in the future.",10.1038/s41531-024-00663-9,Brain stimulation therapy,Frequency,Alternating current,Alternating Current in OLEDs,Alternating Current Driven Organic Light Emitting Diodes Using Lithium Fluoride Insulating Layers,"We demonstrate an alternating current (AC)-driven organic light emitting diodes (OLED) with lithium fluoride (LiF) insulating layers fabricated using simple thermal evaporation.

Here, by leveraging principles of network control, we show how the architecture of the human connectome shapes transitions between 123 experimentally defined cognitive activation maps (cognitive topographies) from the NeuroSynth meta-analytic database. Specifically, we systematically integrated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data from functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tractography, cortical morphometry and positron emission tomography to simulate how anatomically guided transitions between cognitive states can be reshaped by neurotransmitter engagement or by changes in cortical thickness. Our model incorporates neurotransmitter-receptor density maps (18 receptors and transporters) and maps of cortical thickness pertaining to a wide range of mental health, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnostic categories (17,000 patients and 22,000 controls).

Network control theory, the engineering study of networked interventions, has recently emerged as a viable methodology to characterize and guide interventions. However, there is a scarcity of empirical studies testing the extent to which it can be useful within a psychological context. In this paper, we investigate a representative psychological intervention experiment, use network control theory to model the intervention and predict its effect. Using this data, we showed that: (1) the observed psychological effect, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, relates to the regional network control theoretic metrics (average and modal controllability), (2) the size of change following intervention negatively correlates with a whole-network topology that quantifies the “ease” of change as described by control theory (control energy), and (3) responses after intervention can be predicted based on formal results from control theory. These insights assert that network control theory has significant potential as a tool for investigating psychological interventions.

Mathematics,Ecology,Localization of Laplacian eigenvectors on random networks,"In large random networks, each eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix tends to localize on a subset of network nodes having similar numbers of edges, namely, the components of each Laplacian eigenvector take relatively large values only on a particular subset of nodes whose degrees are close. Although this localization property has significant consequences for dynamical processes on random networks, a clear theoretical explanation has not yet been established. Here we analyze the origin of localization of Laplacian eigenvectors on random networks by using a perturbation theory. We clarify how heterogeneity in the node degrees leads to the eigenvector localization and that there exists a clear degree-eigenvalue correspondence, that is, the characteristic degrees of the localized nodes essentially determine the eigenvalues. We show that this theory can account for the localization properties of Laplacian eigenvectors on several classes of random networks, and argue that this localization should occur generally in networks with degree heterogeneity.",10.1038/s41598-017-01010-0,Laplacian Matrices,eigenvectors,spectral graphy theory,Controlling river networks,Controllability and heterogeneity of river networks using spectral graph theory approach,"River networks are important landscape features that have been extensively studied over many years. While seminal works have focused on characterizing the topological properties of river networks, the quantification of their spectral properties has received limited attention. In this study, through a graph-theoretic formulation of river network topology, we investigate the eigenvalue spectra of its connectivity matrix (i.e., adjacency matrix). First, we explain the observed range of zero eigenvalues on the spectra using the notion of multiplicity (i.e., algebraic and geometric multiplicity) for both undirected and directed river networks. Next, we investigate the physical meaning of the multiplicity of zero eigenvalues on the dynamics of the river network. We show that multiplicity of zero eigenvalues is sufficient to determine the minimum set of driver nodes on the river network. The ratio of the number of driver nodes vs total number of nodes is a measurement of controllability of the river network, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the system’s dynamics under external forcing. Using both synthetic and natural river networks, we show that with increasing heterogeneity, quantified via Tokunaga c-value, the number of zero eigenvalues increases indicating that basins in humid climate require more number of driver nodes to control their network dynamics. Finally, we show that driver nodes tend to avoid critical nodes identified via pairwise connectivity. Our results indicate that the multiplicity of zero eigenvalues in the eigenvalue spectrum can serve as a valuable tool for understanding and quantifying the physical and dynamical properties of river networks, such as controllability and heterogeneity. Furthermore, our findings establish a clear connection between controllability metrics and the vulnerability of river networks",10.1038/s41598-025-94886-2,,Methodological Links,
Historical Philosophy,Technology,In retrospect: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"Fifty years ago, a short book appeared under the intriguing title The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Its author, Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996), had begun his academic life as a physicist but had migrated to the history and philosophy of science. His main argument in the book — his second work, following a study of the Copernican revolution in astronomy — was that scientific activity unfolds according to a repeating pattern, which we can discern by studying its history.",10.1038/484164a,Structure of science,"evolution, phase transitions","paradigm shifts, non-linear progress",technological innovation,Technological Change: The Evolution of Technology,,10.1126/science.245.4921.991.a,foundational epistemology,Foundational/Philosophical,
