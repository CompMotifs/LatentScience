# Prompting LLMs to rephrase
To distill knowledge from research papers, we ask an LLM to identify the following concepts and reduce them into simplified language:
1. shared applied concept
2. methodological links
3. foundational philosophical links
4. cross-cutting themes and challenges
5. structural analogies (e.g., feedback loops, search spaces, fractal behavior)

## Approach 1: prompt each paper to distill core concepts
We will ask the LLM to reduce a single paper into the following ideas (this is basically the 'single' version of the 2-paper list above):
1. applied concept
2. methodologies
3. foundational philosophies
4. themes and challenges
5. structural challenges (e.g., feedback loops, search spaces, fractal behavior)

We want each LLM to list multiple for each of the above.
