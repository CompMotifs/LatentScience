## Prompting LLMs to rephrase
To distill knowledge from research papers, we ask an LLM to identify the following concepts and reduce them into simplified language:
1. shared applied concept
2. methodological links
3. foundational philosophical links
4. cross-cutting themes and challenges
5. structural analogies (e.g., feedback loops, search spaces, fractal behavior)
